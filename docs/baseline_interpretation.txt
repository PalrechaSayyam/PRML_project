Baseline Model Comparison Summary
---------------------------------
Total tasks analyzed: 12

RF performed better (ROC-AUC and/or PR-AUC) on: NR-AR-LBD, NR-Aromatase, NR-AR, NR-AhR, NR-PPAR-gamma, NR-ER-LBD, SR-ARE, SR-HSE, SR-p53, SR-MMP
SVM performed better (ROC-AUC and/or PR-AUC) on: NR-AR-LBD, NR-PPAR-gamma, NR-ER-LBD, NR-ER, SR-ATAD5, SR-ARE

Observations:
- Tasks where RF performs better likely have non-linear relationships or substructure-level signal
  that RF's ensemble of trees can capture, even with some noise or imbalance.
- Tasks where SVM performs better are probably more linearly separable in the ECFP fingerprint space,
  suggesting that the active vs inactive molecules are well separated by a simple hyperplane.
- SVM may also dominate when data imbalance is less severe, since it does not inherently rebalance samples.
- Conversely, RF tends to perform more robustly when the data is noisy or mildly imbalanced, due to bagging and random feature selection.

Interpretation:
These performance splits imply that some Tox21 endpoints (e.g., receptor-based assays with consistent
chemical scaffolds) are easier to classify linearly, while others (e.g., stress-response assays) need
nonlinear models like RF that can capture higher-order feature interactions.

Next Step:
This justifies tuning RF/XGB (to improve imbalance handling) and later comparing to GNN models
to see if structure-based learning helps in tasks that defeated both SVM and RF.
